# T3 Code watch

A Godspeed always-on agent ("T3 watch") reviews new T3 Code commits and releases
(github.com/pingdotgg/t3code), decides which features are worth having in Godspeed, implements the
best one natively per run, and opens a pull request for review. It never merges.

Reviewed T3 through: pingdotgg/t3code@339179f50a84dc599cce373dbb48f172f182f44e (2026-10-15)

## Rules

- Port the idea, not the code: T3 is TypeScript/Electron, Godspeed is Rust/GPUI. Fit Godspeed's
  architecture and style; keep the UI consistent with what exists.
- Out of scope (decided): plan mode, rewind/checkpoints, account fallback, mid-thread provider
  switching, T3 Connect relay and T3 mobile compatibility, SnapShots, browser cookie import, usage
  and cost page.
- Skip T3-internal work (Electron, React, its relay, its CI), and anything Godspeed already does as
  well or better (check `docs/godspeed/PARITY-T3.md` and the code).
- One feature per pull request, with tests for real behaviour.

## Ledger

Newest first. Status: `PR #n`, `queued` (worth doing, not yet built), `skipped (reason)`.
