# Upstream (Zeron) sync

Godspeed ports Zeron's commits instead of merging them: the rebrand touches most files, so a raw
merge conflicts everywhere. Each ported commit carries a trailer `Upstream: zeronsh/zeron@<sha>`.

Synced through: zeronsh/zeron@c526d6f7 (2026-10-18)

A Godspeed always-on agent ("Zeron sync") runs daily, ports anything newer than the line above on a
branch, runs the test suites, merges to main when everything passes, and otherwise leaves a pull
request for review. It updates the "Synced through" line in the same change.

Rules for every port:
- Keep Godspeed's user-facing names (Godspeed, `GODSPEED_*`, `site.shrithan.godspeed*`, the
  Godspeed edge URL and WorkOS client). Internal crate names stay `zeron-*`.
- Never bring in Zeron's endpoints, WorkOS client ids, zeron.sh URLs, release/landing infra or tags.
- Skip upstream changes that only touch Zeron's website, hosted edge deployment or release
  tooling, and list them as skipped.
